## 🪜 Setup

### 🧱 Physical setup

To run this project, you'll need a few materials:

- 1 SparkFun RedBoard, with microUSB cable
- 1 breadboard
- 8 jumper wires
- 3 push buttons
- 1 potentiomete

The circuit diagram below shows how to hook up all of the materials:

You will also need a computer to run the web application, and [possibly a monitor](#display).

### 🌐 Web setup

1. If you haven't already, make sure the following items are installed and up-to-date:

   - [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
   - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
   - [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
   - [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)

2. Clone this repository and install dependencies:

   ```sh
   nvm use
   yarn
   ```

3. Run the `develop` command to start the development server!

   ```sh
   yarn develop
   ```

### 🖥 Display setup

The app is designed to be displayed on a screen resolution of 1920px x 1080px. There are a few ways to accomplish this:

- Connect your computer to a monitor with a 1080p resolution. Open the web app in Chrome and full screen it so it takes up the entire size of the screen

- Connect your computer to a monitor with a resolution greater than 1080p, but with the same ratio of 16:9. Update the monitor settings to display a 1080p resolution, then follow the first option.

- Open the responsive screen mode in Chrome Dev Tools. In the inputs at the top, enter the resolution `1920 x 1080`. Update the scaling to fit within your Chrome window.
